### **DC-06: Task Management System and Workflow Guide**

**1. Task Creation:**
* All team members are authorized to create new tasks (Issues).
* Tasks initiated by the Captain have priority, and members can claim responsibility for these tasks.

**2. Prioritization:**
* Tasks should be tagged with "Urgent", "Normal", or "Low" labels to indicate priority.
* In addition to labels, tasks positioned at the top of the list are considered higher priority.

**3. Task Completion and Review:**
* Completed tasks must not be moved directly to the "Done" column.
* Every task must first be reviewed and approved by the Captain before being moved to "Done".

**4. Communication and Issue Reporting:**
* Specific technical questions and task-related updates should be posted in the comment section of the relevant GitHub Issue.
* For general announcements and urgent communication that requires broad visibility, the Telegram channel should be used.
